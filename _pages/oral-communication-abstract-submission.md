There is an opportunity to submit Abstracts for Oral Communications on topics relevant to the theme of the meeting.

The Abstracts as selected by the Programme Committee will be scheduled for oral presentation (10 minutes + 5 minutes for discussion) during the meeting.

Those Abstracts which are not selected for oral presentation can be presented as posters at the meeting.

Abstracts for Oral Communications must be submitted on-line. The deadline is now Friday 17th June 2011 – remember to select ‘Apply for Oral Communication’ as the type of presentation
