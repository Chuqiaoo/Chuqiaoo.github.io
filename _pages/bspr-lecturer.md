<img align="right" width= "140" height ="100" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Kathryn-Portrait.jpg">We are pleased to have **Prof Kathryn Lilley** from the University of Cambridge as our BSPR Lecturer.
Kathryn’s main areas of research are in spatial proteomics and why proteins get to the correct place in the cell to allow them to function. She is also interested in how this is related to the steady state location of corresponding transcripts. Finally, she is fascinated by the fact that a, as yet unknown, portion of the proteome ‘moonlights’ with proteins having different context specific functions. Her research is using a variety of mass spectrometry, NGS, cellular fractionation and machine learning tools to delve deeper into the above. Kathryn is Director of the Cambridge Centre Proteomics as well as the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre.  She is also the European Proteomics Association Juan Pablo Albar Proteomics Pioneer of 2017 awardee.


In her role as BSPR Lecturer, Kathryn will be presenting a series of lectures over the coming year focused on the application of proteomics in biological sciences – her two offered lectures are entitled ‘Proteomics: design and quantitation’ - a talk that describes the protocols and workflows typically used in quantitative proteomics and the importance of experimental design and analysis in achieving robust data. Her second talk, ‘Proteomics approaches to map the three dimensional cell’, shows how it is possible to apply proteomics to give high resolution spatial maps of the cell and how these can be used to map protein relocalisation upon perturbation. The first lecture is intended for biologists who have less experience with the application of advanced proteomics, the second talk is intended for cell biologists with some knowledge of proteomics.

Kathryn gave her first BSPR lecture on Friday 27th October to the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences at Hammersmith as the keynote speaker at the end of their annual student symposium. The audience was PhD students from a variety of different backgrounds and some staff members. She spent half of her time explaining what the proteome is and how we measure it and the other half about how she uses these methods to define spatial maps of cells.
