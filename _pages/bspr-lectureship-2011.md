The BSPR has established a Lectureship Scheme for experienced scientists in proteome research. The Lecturer will promote proteome research and the activities of the BSPR to the wider scientific community, with the aim of increasing the understanding of proteomics and achieving a greater interest in the subject among researchers, students and the public. This objective will be achieved through a series of high-impact, research-based lectures, describing the lecturer’s particular field of expertise and interest. The BSPR Lectureship is an excellent opportunity to increase the profile of the BSPR and proteomics while also helping the individual and his or her institution.

Candidates will be selected from scientists based in the British Isles who employ or advance proteomics. The recipient of the Lectureship must be active in the field and have a good reputation for communicating science.


**Lecturer Profile**

- A Scientist based in the British Isles, who employs or advances proteomics and is currently active in the field.

- The Lecturer must have a good reputation for communicating science, and be committed to promoting and raising the profile of both proteome research and the BSPR.

**Lecturer Role**

- The Lecturer will be sponsored to give up to six lectures in a year. The final number will be dependent on demand and will be decided by mutual agreement.
- Hosts will be able to choose from a selection of two lectures describing the lecturer’s area of research.
- The Lecturer, by agreement with the BSPR, will be sponsored when giving lectures at appropriate international conferences. The Lecturer will recognize the support of BSPR and the goals of the lectureship, as part of the presentation.
