Several bursaries and fellowships are awarded to student and post-doc BSPR members each year. For the BSPR conference 2019 in Southampton (1-3 July 2019) we will offer **ten student travel bursaries and two MJ Dunn Fellowships**. We also offer bursaries for students to attend other proteomics-related conferences of their choice.


**Student Bursaries**

Students (MSc and Ph.D.) awarded a bursary will receive £250 to help cover meeting registration, accommodation and travel expenses for the BSPR 2019 or another proteomics conference such as HUPO.

To apply, please send a brief CV, a statement saying why you wish to attend the meeting and an abstract of the work that you plan to present to Karin Barnouin (kbarnouin@bioapicem.com) and John Timms (john.timms@ucl.ac.uk). To apply for BSPR 2019 student bursary, please apply no later than Monday 27th May 2019. Students must be members of the BSPR to apply. By accepting the award, the Society will expect to receive a report on the meeting for inclusion in the Society’s newsletter and webpages.
