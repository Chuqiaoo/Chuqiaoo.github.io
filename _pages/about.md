**The British Society for Proteome Research (BSPR)**, is a registered incorporated charity (Registered Company Number 6319769, [UK Charity Number 1121692](http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1121692&submit=Run+Search)) and aims to advance the science of proteomics, to further public education therein and to promote study and research work in proteomics and related subjects for the public benefit.

The BSPR represents both the [Human Proteome Organization (HUPO)](http://www.hupo.org/) and the [European Proteomics Association (EuPA)](http://eupa.org/) in the UK and is affiliated to the [Society of Biology](http://www.societyofbiology.org/).


## Aim
The objectives of the British Society for Proteome Research (BSPR) are to advance the science of proteomics and to promote the study and research work in this and related areas for the benefit of all. It enables scientists working in this field to keep up-to-date with current developments both nationally and internationally and to meet and exchange ideas with other workers. Unlike many learned societies we have members from a wide range of organisations including industry and the health service, as well as research and academic institutions.
