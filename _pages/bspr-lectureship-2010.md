The BSPR is pleased to announce a call for its newly established BSPR lectureship for experienced scientists in proteome research.

The lecturer will educate in and promote proteome research and the activities of the BSPR to the wider scientific community to develop a greater understanding of proteomics and greater interest in the subject amongst researchers, students and the general public.

This objective will be achieved by the presentation of a series of high-impact, research-based lectures, describing the lecturer’s particular field of expertise and interest.  As the BSPR lectureship is seen as an excellent opportunity to increase the profile of the BSPR and proteomics, the lecturer must be committed to promoting both.

Chosen from the UK-based scientists who employ or advance proteomic technologies, the recipient of the lectureship must be currently active in the field and have a good reputation for the communication of science.

**Lecturer Profile**

- UK-based scientist who employs or advances proteomic technologies and is currently active in the field.
- The lecturer must have a good reputation for communicating science, and be committed to promoting and raising the profile of both proteome research and the BSPR.

**Lecturer Role**

- The lecturer will be sponsored to give up to 6 lectures per year.  The final number will be dependent on demand and will be decided by mutual agreement.
- Hosts will be able to choose from a selection of 2 lectures describing the lecturer’s area of research.
- The lecturer, by agreement with the BSPR, will be sponsored when giving lectures at appropriate international conferences.  The lecturer will recognize the support of BSPR and the goals of the lectureship as part of the presentation.
