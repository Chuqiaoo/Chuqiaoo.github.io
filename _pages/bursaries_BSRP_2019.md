Several bursaries and fellowships are awarded each year to BSPR members that are either students (MSc and Ph.D.), post-docs, or technical staff. For the BSPR conference 2020 in Oxford (6-8 July 2020) we will offer **ten student travel bursaries and two MJ Dunn Fellowships**. We also offer bursaries for students and technical staff to attend other proteomics-related conferences of their choice. Only one bursary will be awarded per person each calendar year.


**Student and technical staff Bursaries**

Students (MSc and Ph.D.) and technical staff awarded a bursary will receive £250 to help cover meeting registration, accommodation and travel expenses for the BSPR 2019 or another proteomics conference such as HUPO. 

To apply, please send a brief CV, a statement saying why you wish to attend the meeting and an abstract of the work that you plan to present to Karin Barnouin (kbarnouin@bioapicem.com) and John Timms (john.timms@ucl.ac.uk). To apply for BSPR 2019 bursary, please apply no later than Monday 27th May 2019. Only members of the BSPR can apply.
