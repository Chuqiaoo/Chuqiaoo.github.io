## Trade sponsors and trade exhibition
The Conference will include a Trade Exhibition and there will also be exciting sponsorship opportunities to choose from starting at only £100+ VAT ranging upwards to Platinum sponsor.

The Trade Exhibition will take place within the Exhibition and Banqueting Suite of the Conference Centre where the posters will be displayed as well as where tea, coffee and lunch will be served. On the Tuesday evening there will be a chance to network informally over food and drinks while viewing the posters and Trade Exhibition.

Adequate time has been scheduled in the programme for poster and Trade Exhibition viewing only. Oral sessions will be strictly kept to time using a light/audible timer system to ensure that speakers keep to time and that the oral sessions do not encroach on Trade Exhibition viewing times and coffee and lunch breaks.

For full information about Sponsorship and Trade Exhibition Opportunities - please click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/13BSPNOT - Sponsorship and Trade Opportunities version 5.pdf)



## Social programme
The main social event of the conference will be the 'Informal networking session' to be held in the Trade Exhibition area (Banqueting Suite) of the East Midlands Conference Centre. This will be held at the end of the scientific session on the first day.

Afterwards, delegates may wish to proceed to the adjacent Orchard Hotel where accommodation is available, to meet colleagues informally in the bar or other meeting areas.

Nottingham, in the heart of England, is also a compact and diverse city which is easy to reach and easy to get around. The EMCC is only a few miles from Nottingham city centre which offers over 300 restaurants in the city centre alone with continental style dining bars and entertainment, and a Christmas Market. Other attractions include Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem (England's Oldest Inn), City of Caves, and Nottingham Castle. With an early finish to the evening meal, there will be adequate opportunity to explore this vibrant city.


## Accommodation
