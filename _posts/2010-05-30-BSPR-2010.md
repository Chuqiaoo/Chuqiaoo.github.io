We are pleased to announce that, following yet another very successful year at Hinxton, the 7th annual scientific meeting of the British Society for Proteome Research will again be organized in collaboration with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and held in the popular Wellcome Trust Conference Centre from 13-15 July 2010.

- Registration is closed!
- [Poster Abstract Submission]({{site.baseurl}}/poster-abstract-submission-2010) is closed!

For enquiries relating to either registration or abstract submission please contact via email to registration@bspr.org For all other enquiries relating to the conference please contact via email to meetings@bspr.org

The [Final Programme]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/BSPR_2010_Programme (final).pdf) for the meeting is now available for download.

**Meeting Focus**

Protein identification and characterisation was the major thrust of the initial phase of proteomics. Quantitation, however, is pivotal to understanding the differences between cells and organisms under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and is an essential prerequisite for a true systems-level understanding of biological processes. The major focus of this meeting is recent strategies for qualitative description and quantitation of proteomes, and the novel informatic tools enabling their application to the discovery of new biomarkers, the elucidation of biological function, and the construction of cellular signalling and interaction networks. Sessions will cover the application of these technologies to proteomic research from prokaryotes to plants, animals, human and clinical studies.

**Sessions and Topics**:

- Quantitation by Labelling
- Label-free Quantitation
- Modern Array Technology
- Advances in Bioinformatics
- Animal Proteomics
- Clinical Proteomics
- Plant Proteomics
- Protein Dynamics
- Protein Interactions
- Early Stage Career Investigator Award
- Oral Communications
- Posters
