She is also Director of the Centre for Proteome Research (CPR), and Research and is impact lead for the Institute of Integrative Biology and Deputy APVC for the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences. Her research employs biophysical and biochemical methodologies to elucidate the structure and function of post-translational modifications regulating cell signalling in health and disease. Her lab has developed LC-MS-based methods, including ion mobility MS to investigate the structure of proteins and the effects of PTM’s and ligand binding. Claire is offering the following lectures:

* The Expanding Landscape of Human Protein Phosphorylation
* The Top to Bottom of phosphorylation-mediated signaling with mass spectrometry

Prof Eyers Inaugral lectures, hosted by the London Proteomics Discussion Group webinar and chaired by Prof. Kathryn Lilley on 7th August, 2020, entitled “The Expanding Landscape of Human Protein Phosphorylation” can be viewed on [youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6UIdshbEc4&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}
