**Proteomics Informatics Workshop**

The BSPR will be running a Proteomics Informatics Workshop in collaboration with Luis Mendoza from the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), Seattle, US. The workshop is designed to introduce researchers to the ISB’s open-source software tools designed for the analysis, validation, storage and interpretation of data obtained from large-scale quantitative proteomics experiments and methods, multi-dimensional chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry.

Through daily lectures and tutorials, each course participant will  become proficient in the use of these tools, which comprise the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP). More information on the TPP, including software downloads can be found on the TPP Wiki page.
The Workshop will be from Friday 28th June to 30th June at the Life Sciences building at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). The workshop is part financed by BSPR as part of an initiative to provide training resources for its members.
